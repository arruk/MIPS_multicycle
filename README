code and design by: lucas arruk

a MIPS multicycle processor, that supports the following instructions:
- SLL, SRL, JR, ADD, ADDI, SUB, AND, ANDI, OR, ORI, XOR, XORI, SLT, SLTI, J, JAL, BEQ, BNE, LW and SW.

the processor was implemented in a single module, but separated from the memories. 
datapath module is a comportamental verilog code, and it is used by testbench (tb.sv) module for the simulation, with the code exemple in instr.dat.

UMMAGUMA.
